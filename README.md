# Project Overview: Cafe Management System
Our project involves developing a system called the Cafe Management System, enabling customers to access our menu by QR Code through a dedicated website. Three distinct roles have been specified by our stakeholders: 1. Customer, 2. Barista, and 3. Admin. Let's delve into the responsibilities of each role.
